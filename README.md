# Embedded-Systems-Design-Project
This project was developed during the course of Embedded Systems Design, in the 9th semester of the Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering Department of Democritus University of Thrace. Edge detection and edge coloring was required, and then a study was conducted on the clock cycles, how they could be reduced and their effect on memory accesses.
